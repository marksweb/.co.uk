I've been working with django for over a decade now, becoming more involved with the ecosystem over that time as I've
[mentioned before](https://markw.co.uk/tech-lead/django-cms-tech-lead/).

So it was a pleasant surprise for me to recently get a message from someone who was going to nominate me for membership of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/).

It's great to know that people hold you in high enough regard to do something like that, but I wasn't sure if it would get anywhere because I don't have a perspective on myself within the community.

So, after a tough day trying to fix an SSL issue with a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, it was a very nice surprise to get an email titled "Invitation to join DSF Members" while walking around Tesco! I picked up some celebratory [Guinness](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzcjY8eIEX9/) after that.

It also said I'd been endorsed by numerous people. That took me back to the feeling I had at my first conference, Djangocon Europe in Porto, where I was really surprised that people were familiar with me and the [django CMS Association](https://www.django-cms.org/en/about-us/).

Anyway, this is awesome, and an honour.
