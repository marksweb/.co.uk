I think it's very common for developers to neglect their own websites, or not even have one.

For years I've had (and still do) a (shared) hosting package running php with a mysql database that runs wordpress. That used to be cool.

These days it just sits there, not doing a lot other than costing money & the tech world has moved on.

So this is a javascript application using [Gatsby](www.gatsbyjs.com), running on [netlify.com](netlify.com)

I need to work on the CSS next. Bootstrap might save the day.
