It's been a busy year, which is why this is my first post here for a year!!

At the beginning of 2022 I became the technical lead for the [Django CMS Association](https://www.django-cms.org/en/about-us/) after a number of years getting more & more involved in contributing to the various projects.

I've been working with the project since 2014 and made my first contribution in 2017 when I found some issues with the documentation. In the years that followed & as the association was formed, I became very active in the community & had plenty of ideas for how to take things forward. So in this role I've got the ability to shape the future & bring about change to help the community & contributors.

There's a lot to keep tabs on with plenty of apps & repos under the dCA ([github](https://github.com/django-cms/)) but the community forms a great team to work with on this. If you'd like to get involved, get in touch with us on [Slack](https://www.django-cms.org/slack)
