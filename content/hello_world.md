I'm a developer, usually writing python to create django applications running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

You'll also find me active on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1199464/markwalker) and [GitHub](https://github.com/marksweb)

Speaking of which, I'm maintainer of [django-bleach](https://github.com/marksweb/django-bleach) and [django-sql-explorer](https://github.com/groveco/django-sql-explorer).

If you'd like some help maintaining a project - let me know.
